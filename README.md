# Turning Customer Data into Marketing Decisions
### Marketing Analytics Case Study using Excel, SQL, Python and Power BI

---

## Executive Summary
This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow that transforms raw customer transaction data into actionable marketing decisions.

The objective is to simulate how analysts support business strategy by preparing data, exploring customer behavior, segmenting customers, and presenting insights through an interactive dashboard.

The analysis focuses on understanding purchasing patterns, identifying valuable customer groups, and supporting targeted marketing strategies using data-driven reasoning.

---

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior
- Identify high-value and low-value customers
- Detect inactive and repeat customers
- Support targeted marketing strategies
- Present insights using interactive dashboards

---

## Dataset Overview
> Dataset will be added later

The project uses transactional retail data containing information such as:

- Customer identifier
- Order date
- Product / category
- Quantity
- Sales amount
- Geographic information

This type of dataset allows behavioral marketing analysis rather than only sales reporting.

## Technologies & Tools

| Area | Tools |
|------|------|
| Data Preparation | Excel |
| Data Querying | SQL |
| Data Analysis | Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) |
| Visualization | Power BI |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub |

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation (Excel / SQL)
- Inspect data structure
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Correct data types
- Basic validation checks

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Sales distribution analysis
- Purchase frequency patterns
- Product performance analysis
- Time-based trends
- Customer activity behavior

### 3. Customer Segmentation
RFM segmentation is applied:

- **Recency** – how recently a customer purchased
- **Frequency** – how often they purchase
- **Monetary** – how much they spend

Customers are grouped into meaningful segments for targeted marketing actions.

### 4. Dashboard & Reporting (Power BI)
An interactive dashboard is created to communicate insights including:

- Customer segment distribution
- Purchase behavior patterns
- Product performance
- Retention indicators

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Customer Lifetime Value approximation
- Repeat purchase rate
- Active vs inactive customers
- Average order value
- Sales contribution per segment

## Marketing Insights Goals
The analysis aims to support decisions such as:

- Identifying valuable customers to retain
- Finding customers at risk of inactivity
- Understanding purchasing habits
- Supporting targeted campaigns instead of mass marketing

---

## Future Improvements
- Customer churn prediction
- Customer lifetime value modeling
- Campaign performance evaluation
- Automated segmentation updates
